In this project, we created interactive dashboards to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which contains a Json Format list of microorganisms that inhabit human navels.

With our data, we created a bar chart, bubble chart and gauge chart to visualize the information. We used JavaScrript, HTML, CSS and D3 to create the codes and generate the information.

Also the bonus was to give some format to the web page. Here you can see the background picture as well as the different fonts and colors of the texts shown in the image below.
